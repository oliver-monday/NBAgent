# NBAgent — CLAUDE.md

You are the technical co-builder for **NBAgent**, an autonomous NBA player props prediction system. Read this file first on every session, then load the `@docs/` files relevant to the task at hand.

## What NBAgent Does

A self-improving multi-agent system that runs entirely via GitHub Actions. Every day it:

1. Ingests fresh ESPN box scores and game data (`espn_daily_ingest.py`, `espn_player_ingest.py`)
2. Scrapes Rotowire for injury updates hourly (`rotowire_injuries_only.py`)
3. **Auditor** grades yesterday's picks + parlays, writes structured feedback to `audit_log.json` + rolls up `audit_summary.json`
4. **Quant** computes deterministic per-player stats cards from raw game logs — tier hit rates, best qualifying tier per stat, trend (L5 vs L20), home/away splits, B2B flag and quantified B2B hit rates, opponent defense rating, spread context, matchup-specific tier hit rates, teammate correlations (Pearson r + correlation tags), game pace context, and bounce-back profiles per player per stat
5. **Analyst** reads today's slate + Quant output + Auditor feedback + Rolling summary → calls Claude API → generates prop picks
6. **Lineup Watch** post-processes picks after each injury refresh — voids OUT picks, flags DOUBTFUL/QUESTIONABLE picks with risk levels
7. **Parlay** reads today's picks → builds scored combinations → calls Claude API → generates 3–5 curated parlays
8. Builds and deploys a static frontend to GitHub Pages

Picks: **PTS / REB / AST / 3PM** — OVER only, ≥70% confidence.
API cost: ~$0.36/day (analyst + parlay + auditor combined at current slate sizes).

## Workflow Chain

```
ingest.yml → auditor.yml → analyst.yml (rotowire refresh → quant → analyst → parlay → deploy)
injuries.yml runs independently on hourly schedule (rotowire → lineup_watch → lineup_update → site rebuild)
```

- All workflows: `TZ: America/Los_Angeles`
- Commits: `github-actions[bot]` with `[skip ci]` to prevent loops
- **Required secret:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Model used by all LLM agents:** `claude-sonnet-4-6`

## Agent Config (quick reference)

| Agent | Model | MAX_TOKENS | Key inputs | Key output |
|-------|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| quant.py | — (pure Python) | — | player_game_log, team_game_log, nba_master, player_whitelist | player_stats.json |
| analyst.py | claude-sonnet-4-6 (claude-opus-4-6 when >30 active players) | 16384 | player_stats.json, injuries, audit_log (last 5), audit_summary, nba_season_context | picks.json (append) |
| parlay.py | claude-sonnet-4-6 | 4096 | picks.json, player_stats.json, audit_log (last 3 parlay feedback) | parlays.json (append) |
| auditor.py | claude-sonnet-4-6 | 2048 | picks.json, parlays.json, player_game_log, player_stats.json, nba_season_context | audit_log.json, audit_summary.json, updates picks + parlays in-place |
| lineup_watch.py | — (pure Python) | — | injuries_today.json, picks.json | picks.json (in-place mutations: voided, lineup_risk) |
| lineup_update.py | claude-sonnet-4-6 | 2048 | lineups_today.json (snapshot), injuries_today.json, picks.json, nba_master.csv | picks.json (lineup_update sub-object on affected picks) |

## Key Data Flows (non-obvious)

- **`audit_summary.json`** is generated fresh after every auditor run by `save_audit_summary()`. The Analyst reads it as `## ROLLING PERFORMANCE SUMMARY` — provides season hit rates, per-prop rates, and miss classification totals. Returns empty string if fewer than 3 audit entries exist (graceful cold-start).
- **`player_stats.json`** is consumed by three agents: Analyst (pick generation), Parlay (correlation tags, spread context), and Auditor (audit context injection for root-cause grading). Do not change its schema without checking all three consumers.
- **`picks.json`** is mutated in-place by four separate processes in sequence: Analyst appends new picks, lineup_watch.py mutates voided/risk fields, lineup_update.py writes `lineup_update` sub-objects (hourly, conditional on changes), Auditor grades results. Always read the full file before writing — never overwrite with a subset.
- **`context/nba_season_context.md`** is injected into BOTH `analyst.py` and `auditor.py` prompts. Updates to this file affect both agents. The file includes a PERMANENT ABSENCES block at the top instructing both agents to treat listed players as if they never existed this season.
- **Parlay audit feedback loop** — `parlay.py` reads the last 3 `audit_log.json` entries for `parlay_reinforcements` and `parlay_lessons` and injects them into the Claude prompt. The parlay agent now sees what correlation types and leg structures have historically succeeded or failed.

## player_stats.json — Key Fields

Quant output. One entry per whitelisted player playing today. Key fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tier_hit_rates` | Hit rate at each tier, last 20 games (PLAYER_WINDOW=20), per stat |
| `matchup_tier_hit_rates` | Hit rate at each tier split by opp defense rating (soft/mid/tough), full season |
| `spread_split_hit_rates` | Hit rate split by competitive vs blowout game context |
| `best_tiers` | Highest tier with ≥70% hit rate per stat (null if none qualify) |
| `trend` | up/stable/down — L5 vs L20 avg, per stat |
| `home_away_splits` | Best qualifying tier split by H/A |
| `b2b_hit_rates` | Tier hit rates on historical B2B second-night games; null when <5 B2B games |
| `bounce_back` | Per-stat: post_miss_hit_rate, lift, iron_floor (bool), n_misses — full season history |
| `opp_defense` | Opponent's allowed avg + rank + rating (soft/mid/tough), last 15 games, per stat |
| `game_pace` | Combined scoring avg for today's matchup + pace_tag (high/mid/low) |
| `teammate_correlations` | Pearson r + correlation tag per stat pair with each whitelisted teammate |
| `today_spread` / `spread_abs` / `blowout_risk` | Spread context for today's game |
| `rest_days` / `games_last_7` / `dense_schedule` | Schedule fatigue context |
| `on_back_to_back` | Bool — true if today is second night of B2B |
| `raw_avgs` / `avg_minutes_last5` / `minutes_trend` | Volume context |

Full schema → **@docs/DATA.md**

## picks.json — Fields Added Since Launch

The base schema is in `@docs/DATA.md`. These fields were added post-launch:

| Field | Set by | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `game_time` | Analyst | Formatted game time string, e.g. `"7:30 PM PT"` |
| `voided` | lineup_watch.py | `true` when player is listed OUT; pick treated as inactive |
| `void_reason` | lineup_watch.py | e.g. `"OUT: Knee (Rotowire)"` |
| `lineup_risk` | lineup_watch.py | `"high"` (DOUBTFUL) or `"moderate"` (QUESTIONABLE); not set for OUT |
| `injury_status_at_check` | lineup_watch.py | `OUT / DOUBTFUL / QUESTIONABLE / NOT_LISTED` — written to ALL today's picks on every run |
| `injury_check_time` | lineup_watch.py | ISO timestamp of last lineup_watch run |
| `tier_walk` | Analyst | Tier walk-down reasoning string; shown on pick cards as expandable |
| `iron_floor` | Analyst | `true` when quant stat line showed `[iron_floor]`; Claude copies directly from context |
| `lineup_update` | lineup_update.py | Sub-object: `{triggered_by, updated_at, direction, revised_confidence_pct, revised_reasoning}`; written hourly when starter changes detected; overwritten on each run |

## Whitelist Notes

**File:** `playerprops/player_whitelist.csv`
**Columns:** `team_abbr, team_abbr_alt, player_name, active, position`
**Filter logic:** `(player_name.lower(), team_abbr.upper())` tuple — prevents traded players appearing under old teams.

**Player-specific flags (as of March 2026):**
- **James Harden** — appears on TWO rows: one for `CLE` (old team, `active=0`) and one for `LAC` (`active=1`). The tuple filter ensures only the LAC row is active. Do not delete the CLE row — it preserves historical pick attribution.
- **Andrew Nembhard** — removed from active whitelist (role change; insufficient data for reliable picks). Toggle `active=0` if not already done.
- **Kon Knueppel (CHA)** — newer addition; monitor game log volume before relying on his stats.
- **Ace Bailey (UTA)** — newer addition; same caveat as Knueppel.

## Frontend

Four-tab dark theme SPA deployed to GitHub Pages via `build_site.py`.

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Today's Picks | Injury report dropdown, pick cards grouped by game (collapsible). Voided picks show strikethrough + VOIDED badge. DOUBTFUL/QUESTIONABLE picks show risk pills. |
| Parlays | Historical stats banner (hidden until graded history exists). Parlay cards with leg rows, implied odds, correlation badge, result once graded. "⚠ Leg at risk" banner when any leg player is voided. |
| Results | Overall hit rate banner, 4 per-prop streak cards, 30-day hit rate trend chart (vanilla canvas), full pick history table. |
| Audit Log | Latest auditor entry — hit rate stats, what worked, what to avoid, analyst instructions. |

Site rebuilds at end of every Analyst workflow run AND after every hourly injury refresh.
